**Day Zero or Day One (?)**

## Introduction

"Day One" of my #100DaysofCloud is not really my first day. 

Granted, I am a complete noob when it comes to cloud and networks in general, so in September 2020 I decided to turbocharge my learning by scheduling my AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam. 

For seven days, I devoured free videos from [Tim Warner](https://twitter.com/TechTrainerTim), spent too much free time on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/zacharyperkins-2691/achievements), practiced hands on with Azure Portal and [Whizlabs Practice Exams](https://twitter.com/Whizlabs). And I passed! 

On September 29th, 2020 I became Microsoft Certified in Azure Fundamentals! Yet I somehow feel like I know nothing at all, and feel completely underqualified for cloud career opportunities. 


## So What's Next?
So naturally, I scheduled an AZ-104 exam. Nothing like a loaded gun to the head to motivate you. 

I now have roughly 8 weeks to prepare for the Microsoft Azure Admin Associate exam. 


## But that's Not #100DaysofCloud
You're right! That's only about half the Cloud Journey we're undertaking in this challenge. 

If/when I clear AZ-104, my next goal will either be AZ-500, Microsoft's Azure Security Engineer exam, or if I'm feeling burnt out on Azure, the introductory AWS Practioner certification exam. Or perhaps both! 

Wish me luck.
