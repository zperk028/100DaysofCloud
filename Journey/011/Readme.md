# Day Eleven (aka Day 9 revisted) 

## Introduction

Revisting my issues with [Lab 11: Implement Monitoring in Day 9](https://github.com/zperk028/100DaysofCloud/blob/main/Journey/009/Readme.md), in which I failed to successfully deploy a VM from an ARM template and was always left with an empty resource group.  It turns out I'm a moron and the problem was caused by the fact that I didn't know how to correctly download a .JSON file from GitHub. Here's what I learned is the correct way to do it:
1. DON'T RIGHT-CLICK A JSON FILE IN A GITHUB DIRECTORY AND CLICK 'SAVE AS'. If you open that file in Visual Studio you will see a ton of additional junk in the code. That is wrong. Don't do it. 
2. Click through on the JSON file so that you actually see the code/content of it, then click the `Raw` button on the top right. 
3. `Raw` opens the file in a clean browswer window containing nothing but the code. 
4. From the clean window, ctrl + s and download. You now have the proper JSON file.

## Back to [Lab 11: Implement Monitoring](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/blob/master/Instructions/Labs/LAB_11-Implement_Monitoring.md) 
After repeating Tasks 1 to 3, succesfully this time, we pick back up at Task 4.

4. Reviewing the default monitoring setting of our *successfully deployed* VM (which, by the way, is a Windows Server 19 Datacenter). In the VM blade we access the Monitoring section and go into Metrics. From there we create a chart that displays the CPU usage (Metric: Precentage CPU, Aggregation: Avg). 
5. For our fifth task in the lab, we will next configure the VM's diagnostic settings. Still in the Monitoring section of the VM's blade, we click into Diagnostic Settings and enable guest-level monitoring. Once deployed, we swtich to the Performance Counters tab and ensure that the CPU, Memory, Disk and Network of the machine are being sampled. Next to the Logs tab of Diagnostic Settings, where we confirm that Application: Critical, Error, Warning, Security: Audit Failure, System: Critical, Error, Warning are all configured for logging. We then go into the Logs blade of the VM under the Monitoring section and enable the feature. Over to the Metrics blade in the Monitoring section, we are now given the 'Guest (Classic)' option in the Metrics Namespace drop down menu, which gives a new set of options for trackable Metrics. Configuring it to show memory in available bytes (Metric: \Memory\Available Bytes, Aggregation: Max), we're presented with new pretty chart to review our VM as proof of life.
