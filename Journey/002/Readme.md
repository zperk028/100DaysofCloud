# Day Two 

## Planning the Journey

For Day Two, I will be plotting out the roadmap for my #100DaysofCloud journey, by first organizing my study resources and then scheduling my time around them.

### The First 50 Days 

The first half (at least) of my #100DaysofCloud will be focused on preparing for my AZ-104 exam, currently scheduled for December 5th, 2020. That can always be rescheduled if I'm feeling adequately prepared sooner, or pushed back if there are any complications. 

Clearing this exam is my primary objective for the entire journey. Anything beyond that will be icing on the cake.

### The Second Half

Assuming AZ-104 success I apply that momentum toward the AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer Associate), or I will switch gears to AWS to round out my cloud platform knowledge and secure my AWS Practitioner certificate. I will revisit this fork in the road around Day 50. 


## Destination: AZ-104 (Azure Administrator Associate)

The main objective of it all. I was able to drink from the firehose and go from zero networking or cloud knowledge to passing my AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals exam in about seven days. That being said, just having AZ-900 on a non-tech background resume with no CS degree certainly isn't going to land anyone a job. AZ-104 isn't either, but it's a much bigger step in the right direction.

Over the next 50+ days, I will prepare for this exam using the following types of resources: Paid* Courses, Free Microsoft Learning Paths, and Practice Exams. 


### Paid* Courses

The backbone of my preparation for AZ-104 during #100DaysofCloud will be using structured and largely paid course materials:

#### 1. [Udemy (Scott Duffy) - AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Exam Certification 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/70533-azure/) 
* Length: About 13 hours
* Cost: Udemy often has deals running. I snagged this course for about $12.99
* About: As the "concise" (hah!) broad overview of the AZ-104 exam materials, this will be the entry point into my exam prep.
  
#### 2. [Pluralsight - Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/microsoft-azure-administrator-az-104)
* Length: Currently 18 hours at the time of this readme. It is currently under development with the majority of its planned videos not yet released. For comparison, the complete   Pluralsight AZ-103 (the earlier version of 104) path was about 45 hours.
* Cost: Pluralsight uses an overall subscription model, and you can't purchase outright a specific course or video. The standard plan is $29/month. But here's where the asteriks   in the "Paid* Courses" title comes in. I haven't paid for Pluralsight's AZ-104 path. ~~I have a free Pluralsight Limited access account that allows me to work all of their Azure related paths at no cost, and you can too.~~ [Read more about how to gain access to Pluralsight's Azure content for free in this article on Medium.](https://medium.com/itmagination/pluralsight-and-azure-a-great-opportunity-to-accelerate-your-path-to-azure-expert-for-free-42c04e784948)
* About: While currently under construction and spotty on the overall content of the AZ-104 exam, the specific topics they have released videos for will allow for a deeper dive   than Scott Duffy's Udemy overview. Bonus: a few of the videos are from none other than my "Cloud Uncle", the patron saint of Azure exams, Tim Warner. 
* UPDATE: I was wrong about getting free access to the developing AZ-104 path on Pluralsight. I have free access to a smattering of Azure related courses, but none of them are part of the 104 path, sadly. I may use this resource for learning Azure in general, but not as a core component for preparing for my exam.

#### 3. [CloudSkills.io - Azure Administrator (AZ-104) Exam Prep Course](https://portal.cloudskills.io/az-104)
* Length: ~~Unknown. The page before the paywall doesn't tell you a whole lot.~~ **UPDATE:** ~15 hous
* Cost: $7 ~~(but how much content am I paying for?)~~
* About: I'm unsure about this one. I'm considering this additional course content if/when I blow through the first two, or decide that Scott Duffy isn't cutting it for me. To be determined.
  * Pro: it's only $7. 
  * Con: I've already paid for a course that covers the full exam, and have access to more in-depth content on some sections.   
  * Pro: It's co-authored by [the homie Tim Warner!](https://twitter.com/TechTrainerTim). I don't know what it is about the guy - his demeanor or teaching style, but he really helped make things both fundamental and complex click for me during my AZ-900 prep. 
* UPDATE: I bought it. No regrets.

#### Total Cost: ~~$20~~ ~$27
#### Total Length: ~35 hours


### Free Microsoft Learning Paths

Straight from the horse's mouth on [Microsoft Docs, there are six AZ-104 focused learning paths.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator) These are free, text based (no videos) courses, with sandbox exercises and live labs. Also plenty of opportunities to follow along in Azure Portal using your free subscription. 

The six Microsoft Docs AZ-104 Learning Paths are:

1. [AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/)
  Length: 6.5 hours

2. [AZ-104: Manage identities and governance in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-identities-governance/)
  Length: 7.2 hours
  
3. [AZ-104: Implement and manage storage in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-storage/)
  Length: 6 hours
  
4. [AZ-104: Deploy and manage Azure compute resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-compute-resources/)
  Length: 11.25 hours
  
5. [AZ-104: Configure and manage virtual networks for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-virtual-networks/)
  Length: 11 hours
  
6. [AZ-104: Monitor and back up Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-monitor-backup-resources/)
  Length: 6.5 hours
  
##### Total Cost: Zero
##### Total Length: 48 and a half hours?!! 

### Practice Exams

Aside from the quizes built into the Microsoft Docs learning paths, the best way to measure my progress and test my readiness for the AZ-104 exam is through paid practice exams that will simulate the real thing. During AZ-900 prep, I used two variants: Udemy and Whizlabs.  I found the Udemy AZ-900 practice exams to be noticeably dumbed down compared to the Whizlabs variants. 

When it came time to sit for AZ-900, my suspicions were confirmed. Whizlabs was a far superior simulation of the real thing. So for AZ-104 prep, I will be using Whizlabs exclusively:

1. [Whizlabs AZ-104 Practice Tests](https://www.whizlabs.com/learn/course/microsoft-azure-az-104/)
Length: n/a
Cost: Typicall $29.95, but they often run sales. I snagged mine for $19.95. It's well worth it.
About: I only have access to five unique practice tests, so I have to use them at strategic points in my preparation. Yes, you can re-attempt exams, but in my opinion that re-   taking an exam you've already attempted and reviewed doesn't provide my with a clean assesment of my readiness for the real thing. 

##### Total Cost: ~$20
##### Total Length: n/a 
 
 
 
## Scheduling It Out
  
Ok, so I'm looking at least 85, more likely 90 hours of unique content.  Let's just call it 100 hours to be safe, because no plan ever survives contact with the enemy. 

If my target is 50 days, that's a simple 2 hours a day. An hour of Paid Course video, and an hour on a Microsoft Learning Path module - ideally pairing the two on subject matter as much as possible. But life is never really that simple, and right now I know that getting this kind of time in on the weekends will be next to impossible. Barring any big changes to my schedule in life, on Mon-Weds I can do 3 hours a night. Thursdays I can do none. Friday's I can do 4 hours. Saturday and Sunday are a wash. 

##### That's a goal of 13 hours a week. With my current exam date of December 5th (53 days away), this is within the margin of error. 
  
### Target Metric 

"Okay, so that very loosey-goosey schedule and plan is good and all, but how do you really know if you're ready for your exam?"

Good question! That's where those paid Practice Exams come in. My target metric for exam readiness is three consecutive first attempts on a practice exam scoring above 80%. 


## So What Did You Cloud Today?

Uhhh, not a whole lot. I watched the first 45 minutes of the Udemy AZ-104 videos, spent a few hours on Codecademy's Intro to Javascript, and spent at least two hours writing this ReadMe. At least I have a plan now! And a clear resolution to write shorter daily posts...
