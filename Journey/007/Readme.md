# Day Seven (27OCT20)

## Azure Subscriptions and Governance 

Continue on a linear progression through Tim Duffy's AZ-104 Udemy Course.

### Section 5: Manage Subscriptions and Governance

- Subscriptions vs tenants. Resource groups. Navigating the subscription dashboard. All pretty remedial stuff from AZ-900 at the top of this section.
- Assign Azure Policies via PowerShell. Oh boy! Here we go... Scotty Duffy's example here is to find a policy to audit missing tags for resources, with the following PS command line: `Get-AzPolicyDefinition | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq "Audit missing tags on resources" }` Doesn't work on my PowerShell... or in Cloud Shell, so it's not a PS configuration issue on my desktop. `Get-AzPolicyDefinition` alone works fine, and spits back a million results.
