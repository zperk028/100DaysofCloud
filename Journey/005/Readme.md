- Policies and RBAC: Inherit from the scope above (eg: cascade down from subscription to resource groups, etc)
- Taxinomic tags: Do not inherit! They are extremely useful for billing specific resources for specific clients within a subscription, but have to be added and configured manually. 
- Cost Management + Billing blades is used to create a budget or forecast your spend.
- Azure Advisor in the Cost Management + Billing blade can give basic recommendations. If more detailed consumption details and optomization advice (beyond just a cost analysis chart, possibly with "machine learning"), are needed, then the Azure element you're looking for is Cloudyn. 
- Moving Resources and Dependent Resources to New Subscriptions: To move a VM and it's Network Interface Cards to a new subscription you must move all dependent resouces as well. Focus studying on options for moving VMs and NICs within a Vnet, between Vnets, and between Subscriptions.
