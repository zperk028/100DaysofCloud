## zPerk's Cloud Journey

Howdy! I'm Zach. I'm an IT/networking/cloud novice.

I started the 100DaysOfCloud challenge to give myself a framework for continued learning and professional development, and access to a social support network of others doing the same. 

By the end of this journey, my goal is to be either Azure Admin Associate + Azure Security Engineer Associate certified, or Azure Admin Associate + AWS Practioner certified. 

You can follow me on Twitter [@zperk](https://twitter.com/zperk)

And you can network with me [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zperkins/).

## More About Me
I'm a mid-30s career-changer. After 12+ years in an old media career in creative + business development exec, project manager, researcher, writer and sales adjacent roles, I lost the spark for that particularly stale medium. The coronavirus pandemic accelarated my career change plans. In the span of a week, I was part of a mass lay off at work and a mass state activation of reserve military personnel. I am currently still on active duty in my role for COVID response, but I am commited to using my free time as wisely as possible to prepare for a new "future-proof" career in cloud security. 

Cybersecurity is a huge inerest of mine, but I am very aware that one does not simply walk into a cybersecurity career (despite what Bootcamp Inc. would try to sell you). So my intent is to start with network fundamentals, but with a hyper-contemporary twist of using cloud basics as entry point to the learning path.
